# Registration Component Fix

## Problem

The Registration.tsx file had compilation errors because it was missing several state variable declarations and functions that were used in the component. The file was copied from `updated-registration-with-ids.tsx` but didn't include the necessary state initialization code.

## Solution

1. Added all required state variables:
   - `formData` and `setFormData` for managing the registration form
   - `isSubmitting` and `setIsSubmitting` for tracking form submission state
   - `isUploading` and `setIsUploading` for tracking file upload state
   - `isSubmitted` and `setIsSubmitted` for tracking successful submissions
   - `showQR` and `setShowQR` for controlling the QR code display
   - `registrationId` and `setRegistrationId` for storing the generated ID
   - `paymentProof` and `setPaymentProof` for the uploaded proof file

2. Added required hooks and functions:
   - `useToast` for displaying toast notifications
   - `useCategories`, `useDepartments`, `useMinistries`, and `useClusters` hooks
   - `uploadPaymentProof` function for handling file uploads
   - `sendConfirmationEmail` function for sending email notifications

3. Fixed the `uploadPaymentProof` implementation to work properly with the storage API

## Result

The Registration.tsx component now works correctly with the new database schema that includes the `department_id`, `ministry_id`, and `cluster_id` columns.

## Notes

- The component includes a fallback mechanism if the ID columns don't exist in the database
- It stores both names and IDs for better compatibility and data integrity
- It has error handling for various scenarios including database schema mismatches
