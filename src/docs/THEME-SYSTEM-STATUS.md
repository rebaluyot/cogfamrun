# Theme System## Theme Application

Theme colors are applied at multiple levels:

#### CSS Variables

Both raw HEX values and HSL conversions are stored in CSS variables:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #6172f5;
  --primary: 233.1 88.1% 67.1%;
  --secondary-color: #f05a19;
  --secondary: 18.1 87.8% 52.0%;
}
```

> **Theme Test Page Available**: A visual theme testing page is available at `/admin/theme-test` or from the Theme Test Page button in the Settings tab of the Admin panel. This page provides a live preview of theme colors and allows interactive testing. Status

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All theme-related issues have been resolved. The application can now properly load, display, and persist theme color changes.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Storage

- Colors are stored in the `system_settings` table with the `setting_type` column
- Primary color: stored as `primary_color` (HEX format: `#6172f5`)
- Secondary color: stored as `secondary_color` (HEX format: `#f05a19`)

### 2. Theme Application

Theme colors are applied at multiple levels:

#### CSS Variables

Both raw HEX values and HSL conversions are stored in CSS variables:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #6172f5;
  --primary: 233.1 88.1% 67.1%;
  --secondary-color: #f05a19;
  --secondary: 18.1 87.8% 52.0%;
}
```

#### Application Methods

Colors are applied to the page through three mechanisms:

1. **ThemeProvider.tsx**: Applies colors on initial page load
2. **AppSettings.tsx**: Applies colors immediately when settings are changed
3. **theme-watcher.ts**: Browser-side script that ensures Tailwind colors update when CSS variables change

### 3. Usage in Components

Components can use theme colors in two ways:

#### Direct CSS Variable Reference

```tsx
<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'var(--primary-color)' }}>
  This uses the primary color directly
</div>
```

#### Tailwind Classes

```tsx
<div className="bg-primary text-primary-foreground">
  This uses Tailwind's theme colors
</div>
<div className="bg-primary-custom text-white">
  This uses our custom primary-custom class
</div>
```

## Verification

The following checks were performed to verify the theme system:

1. ✅ Database correctly stores color settings with proper types
2. ✅ HSL color conversion works correctly for various colors
3. ✅ Theme colors are applied on initial page load
4. ✅ Theme colors persist after page refresh
5. ✅ Changing colors in Settings immediately updates the UI
6. ✅ Both Tailwind classes and direct CSS variables work as expected

## Migration Status

The database migration to add the `setting_type` column has been successfully applied. The column is now present and populated with appropriate type values ('string', 'number', 'boolean', etc.).

Date of migration: June 11, 2025
