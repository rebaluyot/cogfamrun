# Registration System Fix

This document explains the solution implemented to fix the registration errors in the Family Run registration system.

## Problem

The registration system was encountering errors with the message: "Could not find the 'cluster_id' column of 'registrations' in the schema cache" when trying to save registrations with department, ministry, and cluster IDs.

## Root Cause

After investigation, we determined that the database schema was missing the following columns:
- `department_id`
- `ministry_id` 
- `cluster_id`

While the application code was trying to store these values, the columns didn't exist in the database.

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a two-phase solution:

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (Already Implemented)

1. **Modified Registration.tsx** to:
   - Remove references to the non-existent columns
   - Store only the names (not IDs) of departments, ministries, and clusters
   - Add fallback logic that tries again without the ID columns if they don't exist
   - Add better error handling with detailed error messages
   - Add debugging logs

2. **Updated useRegistrations.ts** hook to handle the case where only names (not IDs) are stored

### Phase 2: Complete Fix (Ready to Implement)

1. **Apply the database migration** to add the missing columns:
   - Use the provided migration script to add `department_id`, `ministry_id`, and `cluster_id` columns
   - Create indexes for better performance

2. **Replace Registration.tsx** with the updated version that includes both ID fields and name fields
   - The updated component is available as `updated-registration-with-ids.tsx`

## How to Implement the Complete Fix

1. Follow the detailed instructions in `FIX-REGISTRATION-ERRORS.md`
2. Apply the database migration using either:
   - The automated script: `node scripts/run-migration.js`
   - Manual SQL execution through Supabase dashboard
3. Replace the Registration component with the updated version
4. Test the registration flow

## Files Included in the Solution

- `/src/pages/Registration.tsx` - Modified to gracefully handle missing columns
- `/src/hooks/useRegistrations.ts` - Updated to handle department, ministry, cluster display with just names
- `/supabase/migrations/20250603_add_church_id_columns.sql` - Migration to add missing columns
- `/scripts/add-columns.js` - Script to check for missing columns
- `/scripts/run-migration.js` - Script to automate running the migration
- `/how-to-run-migration.js` - Instructions to run the migration manually
- `/updated-registration-with-ids.tsx` - Final Registration component to use after migration
- `/FIX-REGISTRATION-ERRORS.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide

## Benefits of the Complete Solution

1. **Data Integrity**: Properly stores both IDs and names for departments, ministries, and clusters
2. **Query Performance**: Adds indexes for faster querying by IDs
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains fallback mechanism if schema issues occur
4. **Future-Proof**: Allows for more complex relationships between entities
