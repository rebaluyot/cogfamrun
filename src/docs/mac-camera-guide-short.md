# Camera Permission Guide for Mac Users

If you're using macOS and encountering the "Camera detected but labels empty" issue, follow these steps:

## 1. When prompted for camera access, click "Allow"
The first time your browser tries to access your camera, you'll see a permission dialog. Make sure to click "Allow" or "Yes" to grant permission.

## 2. If no prompt appears or camera still doesn't work:
1. Click the Apple menu (üçé) in the top-left corner
2. Select "System Preferences" (or "System Settings" on newer macOS)
3. Select "Security & Privacy" (or "Privacy & Security")
4. Click on the "Privacy" tab
5. Select "Camera" from the left sidebar
6. Make sure the checkbox next to your browser is checked
7. Close System Preferences and restart your browser

## 3. Using different browsers
- Safari has the best integration with macOS camera permissions
- Chrome requires explicit permission in System Preferences
- Firefox also requires permission in System Preferences

## 4. Alternative approach
If you continue having camera issues, use the "Manual QR Entry" option which is more reliable and doesn't require camera access.
